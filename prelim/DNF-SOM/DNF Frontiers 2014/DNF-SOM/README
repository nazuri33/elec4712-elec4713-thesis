There are three different scripts within this folder. 

1. DNF-SOM.py

   This script shows the emergence of a self-organized map from a set of skin
   receptors. This script saved the location of skin receptros into
   "gridxcoord.dat" and "gridycoord.dat" and the final feed-forward weights in
   "weights10000.dat".
 
2. DNF-SOM-cortical-lesion.py

   This script shows the reorganization of the previous model after a cortical
   lesion. It requires "gridxcoord.dat", "gridycoord.dat" and
   "weights10000.dat" files.

3. DNF-SOM-skin-lesion.py

   This script shows the reorganization of the intact model after a skin
   lesion. It requires "gridxcoord.dat", "gridycoord.dat" and
   "weights10000.dat" files.
