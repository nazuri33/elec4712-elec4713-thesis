% INDEPENDENT VARIABLES:
%   1. TRAVERSE TIME (brushing conditions)
        % Single condition = longer time, w/ spatiotemporal congruity
        % Double (critical) condition = shorter time, w/ spatiotemporal incongruity
%   2. EXPOSURE TO BRUSHING (how many sweeps before localisation task)
        % Short = less sweeps
        % Long = more sweeps
%   3. DIRECTION OF APPROACH (only applicable to subset of pointing
%   targets)
