Custom simulation that attempts to simulate the conditions and results of the study Seizova-Cajic, T. and Taylor, J. (2014). Somatosensory Space Abridged: Rapid Change in Tactile Localization Using a Motion Stimulus. PLoS ONE, 9(3), p.e90892, on which this thesis project is based, by:
(a) Incorporating modified network from Simbrain 3.03 pre-packaged script, SORN.bsh, using parameters suggested in Lazar, A. (2009). SORN:     a Self-organizing Recurrent Neural Network [Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience, 3] "Occluder task" section (as the task it           outlines loosely resembles the conditions of the experimental context of this thesis project)
(b) Incorporating a suitable stimulus input generator (found in simbrain/workspaces) to simulate the stimulus conditions in Seizova-Cajic     and Taylor (2014) and control of the independent variables therein using a GUI interface. 
(c) Adding an additional readout layer which acts an input layer to a feedforward network (backprop or LMS) that learns in a supervised       manner to accurately model the correlates in Ibid.
