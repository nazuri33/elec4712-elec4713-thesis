Repository for all Simbrain bash scripts, workspace zips, custom simulations, network and other files related to my USyd thesis project for ELEC4712/ELEC4713. Note that the Simbrain.jar file in this directory is my recompiled one, containing custom simulation/s, modified RegisteredSimulation.class (to allow these custom simulations to be opened from the Simulation tab in the Simbrain GUI toolbar) and the compiled SORNNeuronRule and AddSTDPRule classes (and others in the future), which are used by my custom simulation. These added features are mostly stable and don't affect the stability of all other features in the program, but to download the official version of the current stable program, visit: http://www.simbrain.net/Downloads/downloads_main.html. Note that if you wish to then overwrite the .jar file given in the official version with my mod, you will have to copy it from here, overwrite the existing Simbrain.jar, as well as add SORNModWithAbridgingSimplified.zip (from /elec4712-elec4713-thesis/tree/master/simbrain/workspaces) to "Simbrain 3.xx/scripts/scriptmenu/" (where 3.xx denotes whichever version SimBrain is out at the time of reading this) in your local installation directory
